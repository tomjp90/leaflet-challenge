### Steps for visualisation

1. **Get data set from USGS**

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. A JSON representation of that data is provided and using the URL to this the visualisation can be created.

   
2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   A map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

   * Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * A legend that provides context for the map data.

   * The visualisation should look something like the map below.
